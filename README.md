The goal of this project was to create a program that could do an image mosaic: I give him one picture to use as the big picture and I then also give him a lot of pictures to use as the smaller pictures.

### How this works

Put the picture that you want to use as the main picture in the folder  [desired_images](https://github.com/HLCarbon/Image-mosaic/tree/main/desired_images);

Put the pictures that you want to add as the background in the folder [all images](https://github.com/HLCarbon/Image-mosaic/tree/main/all_images);

Run the file mosaic.py;

Voil√†, the final picture appears in the folder [final_image](https://github.com/HLCarbon/Image-mosaic/tree/main/final_image).
